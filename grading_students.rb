# grading_students: Problem:
# given input of integer array, give final grade integer array.
#
# grading_students: Solution:
# Determine number of grades in the grade_array.
# The number n is the first number in the array.
# Create new array to store final grades.
# Apply for each indexed item- if it's less than 38, it's a failing grade. And lower than 38, no rounding occurs.
# Apply for each indexed item- if it's less than 3 points from next largest multiple of 5, it rounds up. Otherwise, no change is made.
# The new grades, having been rounded, are moved into the final_grades array.
